## Own Definitions

## 1. convolution :  
 the applying a filter repeatedly over an input image with an intention to extract features from the image is known as convolution.

## 2. Filters / kernels : 
the operator extracts features from input image by looking part of it. Generally size of kernel smaller than input and the operation applied is dot product.

## 3. Epochs : 
Passing complete training data to a network once.

## 4. 1X1 convolution : 
an input image is convolved with a 1X1 filter, through the number of features can be changed by keeping the same height and width. 

## 5. 3X3 convolution: 
an input image is convolved with a 3X3 filter, to get information like vertical, horizontal edges by leveraging information at neighborhood.

## 6. Feature maps : 
The set of convolved features obtained by repeated application of filter over input image.

## 7. Activation Function : 
A function adds nonlinearity to obtain needed features.

## 8. Receptive Field : 
The area of input layer contributing to one pixel of next layer. Local receptive field is size of the kernel.
